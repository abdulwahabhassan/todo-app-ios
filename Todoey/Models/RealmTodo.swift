    //dynamic keyword is a declaration modifier that informs the runtime environment to use the dynamic dispatch instead of the standard static dispatch to declare this propery so that its value can be monitored and when its values changes at runtime, realm will be able to dynamically update the change in the database. This keyword comes from object c api hence, we must mark the keywrod with @objc
